			<section id="Dark Souls">
				<h2>Dark Souls (Remaster, 2018; Original, 2011)</h2>
				<p>What can I honestly say about this game that hasn't already been said? I enjoyed it a lot, and enjoyed playing it with friends. The first game I played this year, and it's what kicked off my Twitch streams.</p>

			<section id="Hollow Knight">
				<h2>Hollow Knight, 2017</h2>
				<p>This game didn't quite catch my interest the first time around when I tried playing it in 2019, but when I gave it a second chance in 2020, I found myself hooked, barely able to let it go. You'll find yourself immersed in the environments and atmosphere that work together for an unforgettable experience.</p>

			<section id="Nier">
				<h2>Nier, 2010</h2>
				<p>This game has some pretty wonky gameplay at times. However, the true value of this game is the masterfully presented story, and the absolutely astounding soundtrack. Though less known than its sequel, Nier: Automata, there are some aspects to this game that outshine its successor. Soon to be rereleased, this is certainly a game worth looking out for in the near future.</p>
